                        Our site's stylized among those from 2007-2010, (mostly, Kadokawa's) so of course it would look like that.

                        For YouTube, we don't have a channel yet, so enjoy that banger from the Isley Brothers I heard in a commercial (I can't remember, but I think it was swiffers) when I was young.

                    <p>
                        For Twitter, we're probably not going to use it much, but we'll tweet updates and so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Nico Nico, or Nico Nico Douga, like I said, Kadokawa Shoten, and since Nico Nico was popular in Japan (and still is, maybe), then we decided "Let's include this". Enjoy what you get sent to.

                            We are more of a group, rather than a company or corporation (not even a shell corporation, thankfully), as currently, we have yet to be formally founded. And to add to that, this "group" only
                            contains one person, ONE PERSON, and it's the founder, who's currently looking for members, or "employees". However, we aim to be a company that makes games, and maybe software, and many other
                            things in different fields. (Also yes, we are currently thinking of fixing up a city from the ground up. Probably Detroit.)

                            We also want to open a restaurant, a seafood restaurant that serves mostly shrimp to be specific. See "Restaurant Cities" for planned locations.
